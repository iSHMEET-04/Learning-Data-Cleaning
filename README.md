Data Cleaning and Visualization with Python

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates data cleaning and preprocessing techniques using Python. Designed for both beginners and experienced data practitioners, this notebook offers a hands-on approach to handling messy datasets, visualizing patterns, and preparing data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

Overview

Data cleaning is a critical step in any data analysis pipeline. This notebook walks through:

Importing and inspecting data

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Data visualization for insights

File handling in Python

The tools and libraries used in this notebook provide robust functionality for working with datasets of varying sizes and complexities.

Features
1. Data Import and Management
Efficiently load datasets using pandas and manage file operations with os.
Upload and handle files interactively, particularly suited for environments like Google Colab.
2. Data Cleaning Techniques
Handle missing data using techniques like imputation or removal.
Standardize and normalize data for consistency.
Remove or merge duplicate rows based on contextual requirements.
3. Data Visualization
Leverage seaborn and matplotlib for creating:
Distribution plots
Correlation heatmaps
Time series or trend visualizations
Learn to identify and visualize outliers or patterns.
4. File Handling and Export
Demonstrates how to save cleaned datasets for downstream tasks.
Compatibility with multiple formats like CSV and Excel.

Libraries Used

This notebook makes extensive use of the following libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

seaborn: For advanced statistical visualizations.

matplotlib: For general-purpose plotting and customization.

os: For file path operations and file handling.

google.colab: To support file uploads in Google Colab environments.
